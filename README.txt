For best results, use Sodium and the Fabric client and set graphics to Fabulous. Optifine is currently required to see the emissives textures, but only use it instead of Sodium if you care more about having emissives textures than about having good performance. As far as I am aware, Optifine and Sodium are not compatible, so use one or the other.

To download, click the green button that says code on it, and click "download zip"
After this, drag the file to your resource pack folder, and then unzip it in your resource pack folder with any program that can unzip folders. I use 7zip, but any program that can unzip folders will work.

Downloading this resource pack is not necessary, since it is the server pack.
